## Project Overview

Welcome to our project! This guide will help you maintain a consistent and visually appealing user interface (UI) throughout all steps of the project. We'll be using JavaScript to manipulate a target div element and include a Canvas for an enhanced user experience.

## Getting Started

### 1. Retrieve the Target Div Element

Use the `getElementById` method to retrieve the target div element and store it in a variable for further manipulation.

```javascript
// Get the target div element
var targetDiv = document.getElementById('yourDivId');

Feel free to adjust the Canvas properties and drawing functions based on your project requirements.
